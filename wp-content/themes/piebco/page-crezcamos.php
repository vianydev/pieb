							<div class="schedule-info">
								<p>At MBC, groups are the primary way that we care for one another, grow together to be more like Christ, and make disciples together both locally and globally. Church Groups are designed to be representative of the entire body of Christ. Many of our Church Groups begin in different ways, meet in different places, and may look different from one another at any given time, but we are actively working to see each group represented by men and women of all ages and backgrounds, married and single, and families with and without children. That means, there is a place for you in an MBC Church Group! </p>
